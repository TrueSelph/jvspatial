# M4 — jvspatial OAuth 2.1 Hardening — COMPLETION RECORD

> Companion to the plan `2026-06-04-m4-oauth-hardening.md`. This is the
> as-shipped record + holistic adversarial security review + documented
> deferrals. Branch `feat/m4-oauth-hardening`. Commit range `8d99c27..fab089b`
> (the five M4 commits; `7565955` M3a authorize-redirect sits just below the
> range and composes with M4 — confirmed below).

**Status:** Shipped, holistically reviewed, SAFE TO MERGE. No Critical, no
Important findings. Two intentional behavior changes (documented). Two items
genuinely deferred with rationale (Item 5, Item 7b). A handful of benign Minor
follow-ups noted.

---

## 1. What shipped (the five fixes)

| Commit | Item | Change |
|--------|------|--------|
| `8fe442a` | Scope ceiling (headline) | `_intersect_scope` now discriminates `None` (absent key → no narrowing, back-compat) / `[]` (present-empty → **deny all scope**) / `"*"` (wildcard → all requested) / membership filter. `save_authorization_code` no longer collapses `[] → None`, and after the permission intersection applies a **supported-scope ceiling** (`granted ∩ _supported_scopes`) when one is declared. `build_authorization_server(supported_scopes=)` threaded from `routes.py` ← `auth_config.oauth_supported_scopes`. |
| `2ea86cd` | DCR scope filter | `extract_client_metadata` silently intersects the requested `scope` against `server._supported_scopes` when a ceiling is declared (RFC 7591 permits silent filter; gentler than a 400 for zero-config MCP clients). Verbatim when no ceiling. Deliberately does NOT advertise `scopes_supported` in client-registration metadata (would trigger Authlib's hard `issuperset` 400 before the silent filter could run). |
| `a3d5829` | Auth-code CAS | `_consume_code` replaced blind `consumed=True; save()` with an atomic `find_one_and_update({_id, context.consumed: False}, {$set: consumed=True})`. `None` result → lost the race → raise `InvalidGrantError` (same path a replayed/consumed code produces) → token issuance aborts for the loser. Drops the stale cache entry afterward (`_remove_from_cache`). Atomic on postgres (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE`) + mongo (native `findOneAndUpdate`); best-effort read-modify-write on sqlite/json (no regression vs the prior blind write). |
| `9edf957` | Rate-limit | `_get_client_identifier` unauthenticated bucket is now **IP-only** (`sha256(request.client.host)`) — dropped the attacker-controlled `User-Agent` fold that allowed per-request bucket rotation to evade the per-IP cap. `rate_limit_backend` promoted to a first-class `Optional[RateLimitBackend]` `ServerConfig` field (`None` → process-local `MemoryRateLimitBackend`; supply `RedisRateLimitBackend` for a hard multi-worker cap). |
| `fab089b` | jti denylist | New `OAuthRevokedToken` Object (`jti` + self-expiring `expires_at = token exp`), new `denylist.py` (`revoke_jti` / `is_jti_revoked`). `verify_oauth_access_token` now requires `jti` and rejects denylisted jtis. `/oauth/revoke` (`revocation.py`) gained an access-token path: a presented JWT access token is validated, and on `check_client` match (token's `client_id` claim == authenticated client) its `jti` is denylisted until its own `exp`. Refresh-token revocation unchanged. |

M3a (`7565955`, just below the range): unauthenticated `GET /oauth/authorize`
302-redirects to `auth_config.oauth_authorize_login_redirect` (configured base +
original query only — open-redirect safe) when set, else legacy 401. Confirmed
intact and composing with M4 below.

---

## 2. Behavior change (action required for some out-of-tree consumers)

**`permissions: []` ⇒ deny all scope (was: full grant).** Before M4,
`save_authorization_code` coerced a present-but-empty `permissions` list to
`None`, which `_intersect_scope` treated as "no narrowing" — i.e. an empty
permission set granted the *full* requested scope. This was a zero-permission
footgun. M4 distinguishes:

- **absent `permissions` key** (`None`) → no narrowing (back-compat preserved
  for low-level callers passing only `{"id": ...}`);
- **present empty list** (`[]`) → narrows to the **empty** scope (an explicit
  "authorize nothing").

> **Migration:** Any out-of-tree consumer that built `grant_user` with an
> explicit `permissions: []` while *relying on the old empty ⇒ full-grant*
> behavior must now pass an explicit permission set (or `["*"]` for admin, or
> omit the key entirely to keep the no-narrowing back-compat). jvspatial's own
> routes are unaffected: `authorize_post` always supplies a *computed*
> permission set (`get_effective_permissions(...)`), so a zero-permission user
> correctly gets `[]` → empty scope.

**Secondary (strictly more protective, no migration):** the unauthenticated
rate-limit bucket key is now IP-only. Two requests from the same IP with
different `User-Agent` values now share a bucket (previously they were two
separate buckets — the evasion this fix closes). No legitimate caller is
penalized.

No OTHER behavior change for an unconfigured consumer (see §4).

---

## 3. Holistic security verification (adversarial pass)

**Test result:** `tests/api/auth/oauth/` + `tests/api/middleware/` →
**92 passed, 0 failed** (`.venv`, pytest, ~16s; only Authlib deprecation
warnings). M4-specific behaviors are explicitly asserted, not merely present:
`test_scope_supported_ceiling`, `test_admin_wildcard_ceilinged_to_supported`,
`test_scope_empty_permissions_grants_nothing`,
`test_scope_unfiltered_when_no_permissions_provided`,
`test_concurrent_code_exchange_only_one_succeeds`,
`test_full_exchange_issues_exactly_one_token_after_cas`,
`test_denylisted_token_rejected`, `test_other_token_unaffected_by_denylist`,
`test_issued_token_carries_jti`, `test_expired_denylist_row_not_revoked`,
`test_revoke_jti_idempotent`, `test_revoke_access_token_denylists_jti`,
`test_revoke_access_token_wrong_client_rejected`,
`test_revoke_access_token_without_hint`; M3a redirect asserts
`{base}?{original_query}` exactly (open-redirect safe).

### V1 — Scope ceiling composes; no over-grant on any branch; DCR↔authorize consistent

Full grant chain traced: DCR-registered scope (silently filtered to supported)
→ Authlib client-scope intersection → `_intersect_scope` (None/[]/`*`/membership)
→ supported-scope ceiling. No branch over-grants:

- **(a) zero-perm user** → `get_effective_permissions([], [], {}) = ∅` →
  `permissions = []` → membership filter → **empty scope**. ✅
- **(b) admin `*`** → role `admin` maps to `["*"]` → `permissions = ["*"]` →
  `_intersect_scope` returns full requested scope → **bounded by the
  supported-scope ceiling** in `save_authorization_code`. ✅ (the inverted-admin
  footgun — `*` literal matching nothing — is fixed, and `*` is NOT unbounded.)
- **(c) absent key** (low-level `{"id": ...}` callers) → `permissions = None`
  → no narrowing → **still ceiling'd** by supported. ✅
- **(d) supported empty** (back-compat consumer, default
  `oauth_supported_scopes=[]`) → ceiling block (`if supported:`) skipped → no
  ceiling; behaves as pre-M4 **except** `[]` ⇒ deny. ✅

**DCR ↔ authorize consistency:** both `extract_client_metadata` (DCR) and
`save_authorization_code` (authorize) read `server._supported_scopes` off the
**same** `JvSpatialAuthorizationServer` instance built in `build_oauth_routers`
(`register_endpoint`/`register_grant` bind `.server = self`). There is no gap
where DCR would allow a scope the authorize ceiling rejects, or vice versa — they
share one source of truth. DCR uses a *silent* intersection (HTTP 201, unsupported
tokens dropped) and authorize uses the *same* set as a hard ceiling at
code-persistence; defense-in-depth, fully consistent.

> Note (UX, not a security gap): the consent page (GET `/authorize`) renders the
> *client-filtered* requested scope, not the post-ceiling scope, because the
> ceiling is applied later in `save_authorization_code` (POST approve). The page
> can therefore display *more* scope than is ultimately granted. Showing more and
> granting less is safe (never the reverse). A future polish could apply the
> ceiling at consent-render time for display fidelity.

### V2 — No fail-open anywhere

- **CAS lost race** → `find_one_and_update` returns `None` (no match) →
  `_consume_code` raises `InvalidGrantError` → no token. A DB exception
  propagates (not swallowed) → token issuance aborts. **Fail-closed.** ✅
- **jti denylist DB error** → `is_jti_revoked` is called *outside* the JWT-decode
  try/except in `verify_oauth_access_token`; a raised DB error propagates to the
  bearer-auth middleware (→ 500, request rejected) — and even if it were caught,
  the only catch arm `return None` = reject. The caller
  (`auth_middleware._authenticate_oauth_bearer`) treats `None`/exception as
  unauthenticated. A denylist outage therefore **rejects tokens, never accepts
  them.** **Fail-closed.** ✅
- **Scope edges** — `None` no-narrow is still ceiling'd; `[]` denies;
  empty-supported is a no-op ceiling (correct back-compat). No accidental
  over-grant. ✅
- **Rate-limit backend `None`** → `server.config.rate_limit_backend or
  MemoryRateLimitBackend()` (both in the middleware `__init__` and in
  `server_configurator._configure_rate_limit_middleware`) → `None` falls back to
  the in-memory limiter, never "no limit". (And the middleware is only installed
  when `rate_limit_enabled=True`.) **Fail-closed (within configured posture).** ✅

### V3 — Back-compat overall (unconfigured consumer = near no-op)

A consumer that does NOT set `oauth_supported_scopes` (default `[]`), does NOT set
`rate_limit_backend` (default `None`), does NOT set `oauth_authorize_login_redirect`
(default `""`), and runs single-process: M4 is a near-no-op **except** the two
documented changes —

1. `permissions: []` ⇒ deny (the scope footgun fix); and
2. IP-only unauthenticated rate-limit key (strictly more protective).

No other behavior change found. Specifically: the `require: ["jti"]` addition
rejects ZERO legitimately-minted tokens — `JvSpatialJWTTokenGenerator` extends
Authlib's RFC-9068 generator and does NOT override `get_jti`, so every token this
AS issues carries a random `jti`; only tokens minted *without* a jti (which this
AS never produces) are newly rejected. The revocation endpoint's new access-token
branch is additive: refresh-only callers still hit the `_RevocableToken` →
`refresh_store.revoke` path unchanged. `oauth_supported_scopes=[]` makes both the
DCR filter and the authorize ceiling no-ops. M3a's redirect is a no-op when its
field is unset (legacy 401 preserved).

### V4 — No cross-cutting / new bypass

- The jti `require` change does NOT reject anything the rate-limit or consent path
  depends on (rate-limit keys on IP/user-id, not token claims; consent runs on the
  session bearer, not an OAuth-issued token).
- CAS × jti denylist: a code that loses the CAS mints no token, hence has no jti to
  denylist — no interaction, no orphan denylist row. ✅
- M3a authorize redirect × M4 scope: the redirect is a **pre-auth gate** on the
  unauthenticated GET only; the scope ceiling lives downstream in
  `save_authorization_code`, reachable only via the authenticated POST-approve path
  (`async_create_authorization_response`). The redirect cannot bypass the ceiling —
  it never reaches code issuance. POST `/authorize` keeps the raising
  `Depends(get_current_user)`; only the GET seam is non-raising. ✅
- New access-token revocation is NOT a DoS / arbitrary-denylist surface: Authlib's
  `authenticate_token` enforces `authenticate_endpoint_client` then
  `token.check_client(client)` *before* `revoke_token`. `_RevocableAccessToken.check_client`
  compares the token's `client_id` claim to the authenticated client, AND the token
  string must verify as a valid, non-expired, audience-bound JWT. A caller can only
  denylist a jti for a token issued to their own authenticated client that they
  physically present. ✅

### V5 — Deferred items are genuinely deferred, not half-done

- **Item 5 (RFC-8707 per-request resource → aud):** `aud` is consistently the
  `issuer` (single-resource). `routes.py` builds the server with `resource=issuer`;
  `JvSpatialJWTTokenGenerator.get_audiences` returns `self._resource` (= issuer) for
  every token; RS verification (`resource.py`, `auth_middleware`) and the revocation
  path all check `audience=issuer`. There is NO partial per-request resource
  variation — the seam (`_resource` field, `get_audiences` hook) exists but is
  uniformly wired to the issuer. Clean. ✅
- **Item 7b (trusted XFF):** XFF is NOT trusted. `_get_client_identifier` uses
  `request.client.host` (the immediate socket peer) only; the only `X-Forwarded-For`
  references in `rate_limit.py` are the comment explicitly stating it is deferred and
  NOT parsed. No spoofable header feeds the bucket key. The known limitation (clients
  collapsing onto a proxy IP behind a load balancer) is the *conservative*
  failure mode — it over-buckets, never lets an attacker mint a fresh bucket. ✅

---

## 4. Security verdict

**SAFE TO MERGE.** The headline scope-ceiling fix composes correctly across all
branches with no over-grant; the DCR and authorize ceilings share one source of
truth; every failure mode (CAS lost race, denylist DB error, missing backend,
scope edges) is fail-closed; the only two behavior changes for an unconfigured
consumer are the documented `[]`⇒deny footgun fix and the strictly-more-protective
IP-only rate-limit key; no M4 change weakens another auth path; and the two
deferrals are uniformly absent rather than half-implemented.

- **Critical:** none.
- **Important:** none.
- **Minor (benign, surfaced in per-task reviews; documented, not blocking):**
  - *jti denylist duplicate-row idempotency:* `revoke_jti` does a read-then-insert
    (`find` → insert if absent), not an atomic upsert; two concurrent revocations of
    the same jti could in principle write two rows. Harmless — both rows carry the
    same `exp`, and `is_jti_revoked` returns `True` on *any* non-expired match. A
    later optimization could use a unique index on `jti` or an atomic upsert.
  - *Orphan refresh token on CAS lost-race:* the CAS protects the auth-*code* single-use;
    if a refresh token were generated before the loser's CAS check it could be orphaned.
    In practice token issuance is gated on the code consume, so the loser never reaches
    a committed refresh token — benign. Worth a glance if the issue order is ever
    refactored.
  - *Consent-page scope display vs. post-ceiling grant:* the GET consent page can show
    more scope than is granted (ceiling applied at POST/persist). UX-only; granting less
    than displayed is safe.

## 5. Documented deferrals (intentional, not skipped)

### Item 5 — RFC-8707 per-request resource → token `aud`

**Status:** deferred. **Why it's correct to ship without it:** the AS and RS are the
same process and serve a single protected-resource audience, so binding every token's
`aud` to the `issuer` is the correct single-resource behavior (`aud == issuer`),
verified consistently on issue and on validation. **When to implement:** when jvspatial
serves *multiple* resource-server audiences from one AS (a client requests a token for
a specific RS via the `resource` parameter, and the token `aud` must reflect that RS,
not the issuer). **Seam already present:** `JvSpatialAuthorizationServer._resource` is a
distinct field and `JvSpatialJWTTokenGenerator.get_audiences(client, user, scope)` is the
override point — implement per-request `resource` parsing there and thread the requested
resource through the grant. Until then, do NOT vary `aud` per request (a partial change
would break the uniform `aud == issuer` validation contract).

### Item 7b — Trusted X-Forwarded-For parsing for the rate-limit key

**Status:** deferred. **Why it's correct to ship without it:** unconditional XFF trust is
a spoof vector — any unauthenticated client can set `X-Forwarded-For` to a value of its
choosing and mint a fresh rate-limit bucket per request, defeating the per-IP cap
entirely (worse than the IP-only key shipping now). The IP-only key
(`request.client.host`) is correct and safe for direct-exposure and single-proxy
deployments. **When to implement:** when a `trusted_proxies` / `proxy_hops` config knob
lands — XFF should be consulted ONLY for the configured number of trusted proxy hops
(walk the XFF chain right-to-left, skip `proxy_hops` trusted entries, take the next as
the client IP). **Known current limitation:** behind an untrusted-from-the-app's-view
reverse proxy / load balancer, all clients collapse onto the proxy IP and share one
bucket — a conservative (over-restrictive) failure, never an under-restrictive one.
Document the knob and the right-to-left walk when implementing.

## 6. Commit / merge notes

- Five M4 commits + M3a all on `feat/m4-oauth-hardening`; tests green.
- Working tree carries entangled, unrelated edits (`CHANGELOG.md`, `SPEC.md`,
  `docs/md/security-review.md`, retention module, api-key/cleanup tweaks). Those are
  NOT part of M4 — commit this completion record with an explicit pathspec only;
  do not stage the entangled files, and do not use `--no-verify`. The OAuth
  security notes live in this record (the entangled `docs/md/security-review.md`
  was intentionally left untouched).
